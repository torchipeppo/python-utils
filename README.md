# Torchipeppo's Python Utilities

These are dumb pieces of code I wrote to solve specific problems, and thought might solve more, so this is my place to store them, with the added benefit of maybe helping a few more random people.

These are completely miscellaneous, with little to no relation to one another.

Needless to say, I do **not** claim that any of these pieces of code is the most efficient implementation of its stated task. **Nor** do I claim that these may work in all corner cases. In other words, all these snippets come with **NO WARRANTY** whatsoever. See the `LICENSE` file.

But because they are little random things, they can be used freely, no attribution required. Again, see the `LICENSE`.
